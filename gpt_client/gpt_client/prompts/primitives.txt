pri.move(position, quaternion) - Move the end-effector/gripper to the target position and quaternion. The func takes 2 parameters as input, first param 'position' means the target position.
    second param 'quaternion' means the target quaternion. Both of them are type ndarray. 

pri.get_current_pose() -> position, quaternion - Get current pose of the gripper, This func will return 2 parameters, the position and quaternion of the end gripper.

pri.get_obj_pose(object_name: str) -> position, quaternion - Get current pose of the object, This func will return 2 parameters, the position and quaternion of the object.
example: `object_pos, object_quat = pri.get_obj_pose("object_name")`

pri.reset_robot() - Reset the robot to initial pose.

pri.grab(object_name: str) - Grab specified object according to the input name.
